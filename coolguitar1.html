    Squier Bullet HSS Stratocaster Electric Guitar 2-Color Sunburst</span>>
<br>

This is a guitar made by one the most famous guitar companies, Squire.
<br>
    Even though it is a cheaper guitar, the sound is OK,
    <br>and I would recommend this to people who want to start a guitar, but not sure which guitar to buy.</span>>
